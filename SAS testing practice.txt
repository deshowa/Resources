*Practicing SAS 6/5/16;

* check out the dataload;
proc print data = heights;
run;
* data looks pretty good, equal n, close means, and equal std devs;
proc means data = heights n mean q1 median q3 min max std var ;
by sport;
run;
* lets look at a histogram to see how the data are distributed;
proc univariate data = heights;
by sport;
histogram height;
qqplot height;
run;
* football distribution looks a little skewed, but qqplots look alright and data seems to be well behaved, so let's first run a t-test 

* since only looking at football, let's create football dataset;

data football_heights;
set heights;
put _all_;
if sport = 'Football';
run;

* now I want to test if the heights of the football players are >6.4;

proc ttest data = football_heights sides = u Ho = 6.4;
var height;
run;

* in this case we fail to reject the null that the mean height of the football players is equal to 6.4 , said another way, the evidence strongly suggests that the mean height of football 
players is not greater than 6.4 (remember that Ho really is <=)

* now, I want to see if the heights of the football and basketball players are different than eachother,

* first, let's run a 2 tailed test;

* ho = xf-xb=0, ha = xf-xb<>0;

proc ttest data = heights sides = 2;
var height;
class sport;
run; 

* pvalue = .0004

* there is a .04% chance of observing a difference as large as the one observed by chance given than the Ho = true

* statistical conclusion: The evidence strongly suggests that the mean heights of the football players is different from the mean heights of the basketball players (p=.0004)
* ADDITIONALLY my confidence interval does not encompass 0 so this is nice confirmation;

* ok, I really think that the mean height of the basketball players is higher than the football players, so I will test that;

proc ttest data = heights sides = 2  order = data;
var height;
class sport;
run;

* what about if I broaden my level of confidence;

proc ttest data = heights sides = 2 alpha =.01 order = data;
var height;
class sport;
run;
* confidence interval still looks good;

* my upper tail p-value is .0002;
* there is a .02% chance of observing a difference as or more extreme than the one observed by chance given that the Null is true;
* the evidence strongly suggests that the height of basketball players is greater than the height of football players;

* let's just try a log transformation, assume that the data violates our assumptions;

proc ttest data = heights sides = 2 dist = lognormal;
var height;
class sport;
run;




* ok, now I want to get into 3 samples or more and non-parametric data
* I need a new dataset.  We will use the test scores dataset;

data scores;

infile '\\Client\C$\SMU Data Science\Resources\files for code\hsb2.csv' firstobs = 2 dlm = ',';
input id female race ses schtyp prog read write math science socst;
if female = 1 then gender= 'female';
if female = 0 then gender= 'male';
run;

proc print data  = scores;
run;
* have to sort first;
proc sort data = scores;
key gender math /ascending;
run;


* I am going to look at the differences in scores of males and females in math;
proc means data = scores n mean q1 median q3 min max std var ;
by gender;
var math;
run;
* means and std dev look about the same actually;
* lets look at a histogram to see how the data are distributed;
proc univariate data = scores;
by gender;
histogram math;
qqplot math;
run;

* pretending that hte data do not look very normally dist, will run wilcoxon rank sum test;

proc npar1way data = scores wilcoxon;
var math;
class gender;
exact wilcoxon / mc;
run;
* get a very high 2-sided p-value so we would fail to reject the null (.74)
* there is a 74% chance of seeing a difference as extreme or more as the one observed given that the null is true;
* The evidence suggests that the scores between males and females in  math are not different

* now I am going to test whether scores are different between socioeconomic status;

* first i need to resort;
proc sort data = scores;
key ses math /ascending;
run;

proc means data = scores n mean q1 median q3 min max std var ;
var math;
class ses;
run;

proc univariate data = scores;
by ses;
histogram math;
qqplot math;
run;

proc anova data = scores;
class ses;
model math = ses; 
run;

* we can see in the ANOVA model that the probability of observing at least one 
* It looks like at least one of hte means is different, reject Ho;

* I am going to run kruskall wallace just for practice, although assumptions met and data looks parametric;
proc npar1way data = scores wilcoxon;
var math;
class ses;
exact wilcoxon / mc;
run;

* this is enought for now, when we come back, we will run other non-parametric tests and try out linear combinations to test for other hypotheses;
